# Comp-Graphic-and-Visualization

In designing this software, I focused on setting clear goals and refining my approach along the way to create something that looked good and worked well. This project taught me the importance of breaking down complex graphics tasks into manageable steps and making a clear plan before jumping into the code. One of the main skills I developed was controlling the movement of 3D objects, which made it easier to keep everything moving smoothly and predictably within the scene. This approach will be invaluable for future projects that involve spatial design.

The design process itself was iterative, with careful planning and testing at each stage. I started with a rough outline of how objects and textures would work together, and then I tested and refined different lighting and texture techniques to achieve the right look and feel. This hands-on, trial-and-error approach helped me figure out efficient ways to tweak lighting and textures—a strategy I’ll carry forward into future projects where clear visuals and smooth interactions are key.

My development process took shape with small tests for each feature before bringing them into the larger scene. Creating a 3D environment meant adopting new strategies, like organizing the code in a modular way to keep things clear and flexible. The project was built step by step, with each stage informing the next, and my approach shifted to emphasize adaptability. As the project progressed, I increasingly relied on modular, reusable functions that made it easier to finalize the scene.

Computer science plays a big role in helping me reach my goals, especially as it broadens my technical skills and encourages creative problem-solving. Working with computational graphics and visualizations has given me fresh insights into design and a new way of thinking about challenges, equipping me with skills in handling space and visual data. These abilities not only support my educational growth by helping me tackle complex visual problems but also prepare me for roles in areas where strong visual representation is crucial, like gaming, data science, and virtual simulation design.
